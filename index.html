<p>This module is a direct deconstruction of the object oriented HashMap.mo class in motoko-base
(https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/blob/master/src/HashMap.mo)
into a series of functions and is meant to be persistent across updates, with the tradeoff 
being larger function signatures.</p>
<p>One of the main additions/difference between the two modules at this time besides class deconstruction
is the differing initialization methods if an initialCapacity is known (to prevent array doubling 
slowdown during map initialization)</p>
<p>The rest of this documentation and code therefore follows directly from HashMap.mo, with minor
modifications that do not attempt to change implementation. Please raise and issue if a
discrepancy in implementation is found.</p>
<p>The class is parameterized by the key's equality and hash functions,
and an initial capacity.  However, as with the <code>Buffer</code> class, no array allocation
happens until the first <code>set</code>.</p>
<p>Internally, table growth policy is very simple, for now:
 Double the current capacity when the expected bucket list size grows beyond a certain constant.</p>
